    <!-- Specific -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Specific</h2>
        <p>Goals should not be ambiguous. First, I write down my overall goal and describe precisely what I’m trying to
            achieve.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficult goals, when they’re stated with clear specificity, consistently lead to higher performance.
                (Locke & Latham, 1990)</li>
            <li>Specificity optimized goals always outperform, are more unconsciously motivating and build mastery
                faster than purely focusing on the long term. (Bandura & Schunk, 1981)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Measurable -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Measurable</h2>
        <p>How do I know when a goal is complete? By evaluating my progress. Each goal I write has a series of
            objectives that help me make small steps toward achieving the overall goal. These objectives are precise,
            concrete, and measurable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing evidentiary tracking for abstract and/or complex goals is a key focus of Commit Action coaches
                during their facilitation of the weekly planning ritual.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Assignable -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Assignable</h2>
        <p>Who is responsible for making the goal happen? Are expectations clear and agreed upon by all interested
            parties? On a team collecting and analyzing data, it’s important to identify not just who has which role,
            but what condition the data should be in when it’s passed from the collectors to the analysts.</p>
        <!-- No specific bullet points matched; consider custom integration or omitting -->
    </div>

    <!-- Realistic -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Realistic</h2>
        <p>Can I achieve this goal with my current skills and resources? If not, is it feasible to acquire the necessary
            skills and resources in the goal’s established time frame? Is the time frame appropriate to the complexity
            and amount of effort the goal requires?</p>
        <!-- No specific bullet points matched; consider custom integration or omitting -->
    </div>

    <!-- Time-bound -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Time-bound</h2>
        <p>I establish a timeline for completing each goal and assessing progress. Is the timeline relevant to my
            current deadlines, and does it reflect my long-term objectives?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a specific intention to take action at a precise time more than doubles the likelihood of a goal
                being accomplished. (Milne et al., 2002)</li>
            <li>Deadlines actually help people be more flexible, resist distraction and achieve more (than just
                executing in a wide open schedule). (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- General References about Accountability -->
    <div class="goal">
        <h2>Accountability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Connectedness with others and social accountability is an essential condition for intrinsic motivation
                in Self-Determination Theory. (Ryan & Deci, 2000)</li>
            <li>Ongoing accountability support increases the probability of goal accomplishment to 95 percent. (Harkin
                et al., 2016)</li>
            <li>Just the knowledge of the possibility of impending accountability check-ins increases positive behaviors
                by 50%. (Oussedik et al., 2017)</li>
            <li>Virtual, weekly accountability check-ins conducted by skilled facilitators more than doubles adherence
                to plans to achieve goals. (Oussedik et al., 2017) (Kast & Pomeranz, 2014)</li>
        </ul>
